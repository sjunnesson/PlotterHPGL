# PlotterHPGL
Library and examples to interface a HPGL plotter such as HP7550a to processing. 

To use just download the whole repository and put it in your Processing folder. There is a couple of exampels that shows the capabilities of the library in the examples folder. Hopefully they should be self explanatory. 

Feel free to fork, reuse and redistrube as you wish. 

Happy plotting
